==================
Functional Interfaces
==================

-> The interface which contains only one abstract method is called as Functional Interface

-> Functional Interfaces are used to invoke Lambda expressions

-> Below are some predefined functional interfaces

			Runnable ------------> run ( ) method

			Callable ----------> call ( ) method

			Comparable -------> compareTo ( )

-> To represent one interface as a Functional Interface, we will use the @FunctionalInterface annotation.


@FunctionalInterface
public interface MyInterface {
	public void m1( );
}

Note: When we write @FunctionalInterface(annotation) then our compiler will check interface contains only one abstract method or not.


-> In Java 8 several predefined Functional interfaces got introduced they are

	1) Predicate & BiPredicate
	2) Consumer & BiConsumer
	3) Supplier
	4) Function & BiFunction


-> The above interfaces are provided in java.util.function package
